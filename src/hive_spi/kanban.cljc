(ns hive-spi.kanban
  "The kanban contract between a host kernel and the component that owns the
   board.

   Two role protocols, four methods. `IKanbanRead` is what a scheduler or a
   catchup needs to look at the board; `IKanbanWrite` is what a planner or a
   dispatcher needs to change it. A provider may implement either or both;
   the registry (hive-spi.kanban.registry) keys them separately.

   The port speaks ONE status vocabulary, the public one: todo, inprogress,
   inreview, done. A provider maps its own storage tags to it.

   Contract: no method throws. Read misses are [] or nil; write failures are
   a {:err WriteError} value.

   Protocols are wrapped in a `defonce`-guarded block: reloading this ns must
   not mint fresh protocol objects, which would orphan already-registered
   implementations."
