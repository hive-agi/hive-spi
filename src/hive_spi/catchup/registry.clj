  "The injection point for catchup blocks.

   A catchup answer is composed from BLOCKS. Every contributor, the host's
   own domains and addons alike, registers one:

     {:block/id    kw           the key its value lands under
      :block/fn    (fn [ctx])   returns the block value (a map)
      :block/order int          lower runs first}

   The host never names a contributor: it calls `compose` with a context
   and receives every registered block's value keyed by id."
